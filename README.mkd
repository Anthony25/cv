Personal CV [EN,FR]
===================

CV written in LaTeX using ModernCV, with multilanguage in mind.

The last PDF version is available [here](https://github.com/Anthony25/cv/releases/latest), or you can build it with pdflatex: `pdflatex cv-aruhier.tex`.

To change the language, uncomment one of the lines at line 8:
```
%\usepackage[french,english]{babel} % makes ENGLISH content
% OR
%\usepackage[english,french]{babel} % makes FRENCH content
```
By default, English will be used.
